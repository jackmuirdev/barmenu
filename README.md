**Cocktail Menu Project**

Welcome to the Cocktail Menu Project repository! This project was designed to practice my full stack development skills using React, .Net & SQL. 

### About

This repository contains a curated list of cocktails to purchase, organized for easy navigation and accessibility. There is a shopping cart to add products to and a checkout procedure to purchase the cocktails. There is stripe integration for purchasing.

### Features

- **Sorting and Filtering:** On the catalogue page there is sorting and filtering for all cocktails.
- **CRUD:** With admin logins you are able to use CRUD to customise all the products on the website.
- **Payment integration:** Using the stripe test cards you are able to purchase items off the website and check your order.
- **Authentication:** Users are able to create accounts and login - this will open up more navigation options for the user.
